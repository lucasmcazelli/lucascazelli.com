# Minimum Viable Effect Sizes

**Minimum Viable Effect Sizes (MVE)** define the smallest meaningful improvement threshold for your specific product metrics that justifies implementation effort and resource allocation. Unlike generic effect size guidelines, MVE is tailored to your business context, user base, and implementation constraints.

## The Core Problem

### **Why Generic Effect Sizes Fall Short**

Generic effect size guidelines (small = 0.2, medium = 0.5, large = 0.8) ignore critical business factors:

- **Implementation costs**: A 0.3 effect size might be worth it for a simple UI change but not for a complete backend rewrite
- **User base size**: A 0.2 effect size matters more with 1M users than 1K users
- **Revenue impact**: Same effect size has different business value depending on user monetization
- **Opportunity costs**: Resources spent on small improvements could be used elsewhere

MVE bridges this gap by calculating effect size thresholds based on your specific business context.

## Calculating Minimum Viable Effect Sizes

### **Basic Formula**

```
MVE = Implementation Cost / (User Base × Revenue Impact Per User)
```

### **Step-by-Step Calculation**

#### **1. Define Implementation Costs**
- **Development time**: Hours × hourly rate
- **Design resources**: UI/UX work, user research
- **Testing and QA**: Quality assurance effort
- **Deployment and monitoring**: Infrastructure and operational costs
- **Opportunity cost**: What else could you build instead?

#### **2. Calculate Revenue Impact Per User**
- **Direct revenue**: Subscription fees, transaction fees, ad revenue
- **Indirect value**: Customer lifetime value, referral value
- **Cost savings**: Support reduction, operational efficiency
- **Strategic value**: Competitive advantage, market positioning

#### **3. Determine User Base**
- **Total active users**: Monthly active users (MAU)
- **Affected users**: Users who will experience the change
- **Conversion funnel**: Users at the relevant stage

### **Real-World Examples**

#### **E-commerce Checkout Optimization**

**Context**: Online retailer with 100K monthly users
- **Implementation cost**: $15,000 (2 weeks dev + design)
- **Revenue per user**: $50 average order value
- **Conversion rate**: 2.5% baseline
- **Affected users**: 100K (all checkout users)

**Calculation**:
```
MVE = $15,000 / (100,000 × $50 × 0.025)
MVE = $15,000 / $125,000
MVE = 0.12 (12% improvement needed)
```

**Interpretation**: Need at least 12% conversion rate improvement to justify implementation.

#### **SaaS Feature Adoption**

**Context**: B2B SaaS with 10K paid users
- **Implementation cost**: $50,000 (1 month dev + testing)
- **Revenue per user**: $200/month subscription
- **Feature adoption**: 30% baseline
- **Affected users**: 10K (all users)

**Calculation**:
```
MVE = $50,000 / (10,000 × $200 × 0.30)
MVE = $50,000 / $600,000
MVE = 0.083 (8.3% improvement needed)
```

**Interpretation**: Need at least 8.3% feature adoption improvement to justify implementation.

#### **Mobile App Engagement**

**Context**: Freemium app with 500K DAU
- **Implementation cost**: $25,000 (3 weeks dev + A/B testing)
- **Revenue per user**: $2/month (freemium conversion)
- **Engagement metric**: 40% daily active usage
- **Affected users**: 500K (all DAU)

**Calculation**:
```
MVE = $25,000 / (500,000 × $2 × 0.40)
MVE = $25,000 / $400,000
MVE = 0.0625 (6.25% improvement needed)
```

**Interpretation**: Need at least 6.25% engagement improvement to justify implementation.

## Context-Specific Considerations

### **Industry Benchmarks**

#### **E-commerce**
- **Conversion rate**: 0.1-0.5% improvements often meaningful
- **Average order value**: 5-15% improvements typically worthwhile
- **Cart abandonment**: 2-8% reduction in abandonment rates
- **Customer satisfaction**: 0.2-0.5 Cohen's d for satisfaction scores

#### **SaaS Products**
- **Feature adoption**: 5-20% improvement in adoption rates
- **User retention**: 2-10% improvement in monthly retention
- **Support tickets**: 10-30% reduction in ticket volume
- **Time to value**: 15-40% reduction in onboarding time

#### **Content Platforms**
- **Engagement metrics**: 5-15% improvement in time on site
- **Sharing behavior**: 10-25% increase in social shares
- **Content consumption**: 8-20% improvement in completion rates
- **User-generated content**: 15-40% increase in UGC creation

### **Business Model Considerations**

#### **Freemium Models**
- **Conversion to paid**: Small improvements (2-5%) can have large revenue impact
- **Engagement metrics**: Medium improvements (10-20%) drive conversion
- **Feature usage**: Large improvements (20-40%) differentiate from free tier

#### **Subscription Models**
- **Retention rates**: Small improvements (2-8%) compound over time
- **Feature adoption**: Medium improvements (10-25%) increase stickiness
- **Customer satisfaction**: Medium improvements (0.3-0.6 Cohen's d) reduce churn

#### **Marketplace Models**
- **Supply-side metrics**: Large improvements (20-50%) needed for network effects
- **Demand-side metrics**: Medium improvements (10-30%) drive marketplace health
- **Transaction volume**: Small improvements (5-15%) can be highly profitable

## Implementation Framework

### **Pre-Experiment Planning**

#### **1. Define MVE Thresholds**
- **Primary metric**: Most important business outcome
- **Secondary metrics**: Supporting evidence metrics
