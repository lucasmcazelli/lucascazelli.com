# Cost-Benefit Analysis Templates

**Cost-benefit analysis templates** provide structured frameworks for evaluating the financial and strategic value of experiments to prioritize optimization efforts and resource allocation. These templates transform abstract optimization opportunities into concrete business decisions by quantifying costs, benefits, and return on investment.

## The Prioritization Challenge

### **Why Experiments Need Business Justification**

**Common Experiment Scenarios**:
- **Multiple opportunities**: 20 potential optimizations, limited resources
- **Unclear value**: Which experiments will have the biggest impact?
- **Resource constraints**: Budget and team capacity limitations
- **Strategic alignment**: Which experiments support business goals?

**Without CBA templates**:
- **Gut-feeling decisions**: Subjective prioritization without data
- **Resource waste**: Investing in low-impact experiments
- **Missed opportunities**: Overlooking high-value optimizations
- **Stakeholder confusion**: Unclear rationale for experiment choices

**With CBA templates**:
- **Data-driven decisions**: Objective prioritization based on business value
- **Resource optimization**: Focus on highest-impact experiments
- **Clear communication**: Transparent rationale for stakeholders
- **Strategic alignment**: Experiments that support business objectives

## Core CBA Framework

### **Basic Cost-Benefit Formula**

```
ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100%
```

**Where**:
- **Benefits**: Revenue increase, cost savings, strategic value
- **Costs**: Development, testing, implementation, opportunity costs
- **ROI**: Return on investment percentage

### **Extended CBA Framework**

```
Net Present Value = Σ(Benefits - Costs) / (1 + r)^t
```

**Where**:
- **NPV**: Net present value of experiment
- **r**: Discount rate (cost of capital)
- **t**: Time period (months/years)

## Cost Categories

### **Development Costs**

#### **Direct Development**
- **Engineering time**: Hours × hourly rate
- **Design resources**: UI/UX, user research, prototyping
- **Product management**: Planning, coordination, stakeholder management
- **Quality assurance**: Testing, bug fixes, validation

#### **Implementation Costs**
- **Infrastructure**: Servers, databases, third-party services
- **Deployment**: Release management, monitoring, rollback planning
- **Training**: User education, documentation, support materials

## Advanced CBA Considerations

### **Risk Assessment**

#### **Technical Risk**
- **Implementation complexity**: High complexity = higher risk
- **Dependencies**: External dependencies increase risk
- **Team expertise**: Unfamiliar technologies increase risk
- **Timeline pressure**: Rushed implementations increase risk

#### **Business Risk**
- **Market changes**: External factors affecting demand
- **Competitive response**: Competitor actions affecting value
- **User adoption**: Uncertainty about user acceptance
- **Regulatory changes**: Compliance requirements affecting implementation

#### **Risk-Adjusted ROI**
```
Risk-Adjusted ROI = Expected ROI × (1 - Risk Probability)
```

### **Time Value of Money**

#### **Net Present Value (NPV)**
- **Discount rate**: Cost of capital (typically 8-12%)
- **Time horizon**: How long benefits will accrue
- **Present value**: Benefits discounted to present day
- **NPV calculation**: Present value of benefits minus costs

#### **Payback Period**
- **Simple payback**: Time to recover initial investment
- **Discounted payback**: Time considering time value of money
- **Break-even analysis**: Point where benefits equal costs

### **Sensitivity Analysis**

#### **Variable Sensitivity**
- **Benefit assumptions**: How sensitive is ROI to benefit estimates?
- **Cost assumptions**: How sensitive is ROI to cost estimates?
- **Timeline assumptions**: How sensitive is ROI to implementation timeline?
- **Market assumptions**: How sensitive is ROI to market conditions?

#### **Scenario Planning**
- **Best case**: Optimistic assumptions about benefits and costs
- **Base case**: Most likely assumptions about benefits and costs
- **Worst case**: Pessimistic assumptions about benefits and costs
- **Decision framework**: How to proceed under different scenarios

## Implementation Framework

### **Pre-Experiment CBA**

#### **Opportunity Assessment**
- **Problem identification**: What business problem are you solving?
- **Solution definition**: How will the experiment address the problem?

- **Payback period**: Maximum acceptable payback time (typically 6-18 months)
- **Strategic alignment**: Does experiment support business goals?
- **Resource availability**: Are required resources available?

### **Post-Experiment CBA**

#### **Actual vs. Projected**
- **Cost comparison**: Actual costs vs. projected costs
- **Benefit comparison**: Actual benefits vs. projected benefits

- **Knowledge sharing**: Share learnings with other teams

### **Portfolio-Level CBA**

#### **Resource Allocation**

- **Resource distribution**: Allocate resources across highest-value experiments
- **Timeline planning**: Schedule experiments based on resource availability

#### **Cross-Experiment Learning**
- **Cost patterns**: Typical cost structures for different experiment types
- **Benefit patterns**: Typical benefit ranges for different experiment types
- **Success factors**: What drives higher ROI in experiments?
- **Failure patterns**: Common reasons for low ROI experiments

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### **Cost Underestimation**

#### **Hidden Costs**
- **Problem**: Missing indirect costs like opportunity costs
- **Solution**: Include all cost categories in CBA template
- **Example**: Include PM time, QA time, infrastructure costs

#### **Scope Creep**
- **Problem**: Experiment scope expands beyond original plan
- **Solution**: Define clear scope and include contingency buffer
- **Example**: Add 20-30% contingency to cost estimates

### **Benefit Overestimation**

#### **Attribution Errors**
- **Problem**: Crediting experiment for improvements not caused by it
- **Solution**: Use conservative benefit estimates and attribution methods
- **Example**: Use incremental attribution rather than total attribution

#### **Market Assumptions**
- **Problem**: Assuming benefits will continue indefinitely
- **Solution**: Use realistic time horizons and decay assumptions
- **Example**: Assume benefits decay 10-20% annually

### **Analysis Errors**

#### **Incomplete Analysis**
- **Problem**: Focusing only on direct costs and benefits
- **Solution**: Include all relevant cost and benefit categories
- **Example**: Include opportunity costs, strategic value, risk factors

#### **Static Analysis**
- **Problem**: Not considering how costs and benefits change over time
- **Solution**: Use dynamic models that account for time value of money
- **Example**: Use NPV calculations with appropriate discount rates
