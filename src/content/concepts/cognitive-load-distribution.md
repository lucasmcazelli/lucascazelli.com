# Cognitive Load Distribution

The mind, like a structure, has limited capacity. **Cognitive load distribution** describes how mental effort spreads across different processing systems when engaging with content.

## The Parallel to Stress Distribution

In structural engineering, stress distribution shows how forces spread through materials. In cognitive science, we map how mental effort flows through neural pathways:

- **Point loads** → **Attention spikes** (surprising moments)
- **Distributed loads** → **Sustained focus** (continuous narrative)
- **Stress concentration** → **Cognitive overload** (too much information)

## The Three-Channel Model

```
Visual Channel:    [████████░░] 80% capacity
Auditory Channel:  [████░░░░░░] 40% capacity  
Working Memory:    [██████░░░░] 60% capacity
```

When any channel exceeds 100%, we see:
- Attention dropout
- Information loss
- Viewer frustration

## The Dual-Process Foundation

Based on Kahneman's System 1 and System 2:

### System 1 (Automatic Processing)
- **Load coefficient**: 0.3 (effortless)
- **Speed**: Fast, parallel
- **Capacity**: High
- **Examples**: Pattern recognition, emotional responses, simple decisions

### System 2 (Deliberate Processing)
- **Load coefficient**: 1.0 (effortful)
- **Speed**: Slow, serial
- **Capacity**: Limited (~7±2 items)
- **Examples**: Complex reasoning, mathematical calculation, self-control

## Measuring at North AI

We track cognitive load through proxy metrics:

1. **Eye movement velocity** - faster = higher load
2. **Blink suppression** - fewer blinks = intense focus
3. **Gaze dispersion** - scattered = overwhelmed
4. **Pupil dilation** - larger = more effort
5. **Micro-expressions** - frustration indicators

### The Load Formula

```
Total Load(t) = Visual(t) + Auditory(t) + Working_Memory(t) + Emotional(t)
```

Where each component is weighted by its processing cost.

## Practical Application

When designing video content:

### Load Management Strategies
- **Front-load with System 1** - easy, visual, emotional
- **Introduce complexity gradually** - build mental models
- **Provide cognitive rest periods** - let the brain consolidate
- **Never exceed 85% total load** - maintain processing buffer

### The Attention Curve
```
Load %
100|     /\      /\
 80|    /  \    /  \
 60|   /    \  /    \
 40|  /      \/      \
 20| /                \
  0|____________________
   0  10  20  30  40  50 seconds
```

### Optimal Distribution Patterns

1. **Hook Phase** (0-5s): High visual, low cognitive
2. **Setup Phase** (5-15s): Moderate load, establish context
3. **Development** (15-45s): Variable load, build complexity
4. **Resolution** (45-60s): Reduce load, consolidate learning

## Engineering Parallels

| Structural Engineering | Cognitive Science |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Stress concentration factors | Cognitive overload points |
| Material fatigue limits | Attention span limits |
| Load path optimization | Information flow design |
| Safety factors | Cognitive buffers |
| Stress-strain curves | Load-performance curves |

## Real-World Examples

### Video Content
- **TikTok**: 15s bursts, high visual load, minimal cognitive
- **Educational**: Gradual complexity, frequent checkpoints
- **Entertainment**: Emotional hooks, narrative flow

### Product Design
- **Onboarding**: Progressive disclosure, low initial load
- **Complex features**: Guided workflows, cognitive scaffolding
- **Error states**: Clear explanations, low emotional load

### User Interfaces
- **Navigation**: Consistent patterns (System 1)
- **Data entry**: Validation feedback (System 2 support)
- **Information display**: Chunked, scannable formats

## The Load-Performance Relationship

Like stress-strain curves in materials:

```
Performance
    100|     /\      /\
     80|    /  \    /  \
     60|   /    \  /    \
     40|  /      \/      \
     20| /                \
      0|____________________
       0  20  40  60  80 100 Load %
```

- **Elastic zone**: Performance scales with load
- **Yield point**: Diminishing returns begin
- **Failure point**: Complete attention loss

## Optimization Strategies

### For Content Creators
1. **Map your load curve** - identify peak stress points
2. **Design for dual processing** - engage both systems strategically
3. **Build in recovery periods** - prevent cognitive fatigue
4. **Test with real users** - validate your load assumptions

### For Product Teams
1. **Measure cognitive metrics** - track attention, engagement, completion
2. **A/B test load variations** - find optimal complexity levels
3. **Design progressive disclosure** - reveal complexity gradually
4. **Monitor cognitive fatigue** - watch for engagement dropoff
