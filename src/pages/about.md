# About

## The Short Version

I'm Lucas Cazelli, CPO & Co-founder at [North AI](https://north-ai.com), where we're building synthetic audiences for video analytics using neuroscience-inspired AI. 

Previously, I optimized physical structures as a civil engineer. Now I optimize attention and decision-making in digital products.

Based in London. Building in public. Writing about the intersection of neuroscience, product management, and statistical thinking.

## The Longer Version

### From Structures to Synapses

My journey started in civil engineering, where I spent years applying finite element analysis to optimize load distribution in physical structures. The transition to product might seem unusual, but the core challenge remains the same: **understanding how complex systems handle stress and distribute resources**.

In engineering, it was about concrete and steel. In product, it's about cognitive load and attention.

### What I'm Building Now

At **North AI**, we're creating what doesn't exist yet: synthetic audiences that can predict how real humans will respond to video content. We combine:
- Eye-tracking and gaze synchronization patterns
- EEG-proxy metrics for cognitive engagement
- Multi-agent AI systems for behavioral simulation
- Statistical clustering for psychographic segmentation

Think of it as a "virtual focus group" that never gets tired, never lies, and can represent millions of viewers simultaneously.

### The Builder Mindset

I've always been a maker. Whether it's:
- **Software**: From accounting APIs processing 50M daily transactions to real-time video analytics
- **Hardware**: Arduino-powered kinetic sculptures and 3D-printed mechanisms
- **Products**: Launching everything from blockchain film financing to B2C streaming platforms

The tools change. The drive to build doesn't.

### My Approach to Product

**Discovery â‰  Delivery**. I run dual-track product development with clear gates between exploration and execution. 

I believe in:
- **Outcome-driven roadmaps** over feature factories
- **Statistical rigor** over gut feelings (though System 1 thinking has its place)
- **Rapid experimentation** with <30-second calibration flows, not 2-minute ones
- **Clear communication** - if it can't fit in a one-pager, it's not ready

### Technical Foundation

- **Engineering**: BSc Civil Engineering, structural optimization
- **Data**: Advanced statistics, Six Sigma, experiment design
- **Product**: 5+ years leading products from zero to exit
- **Code**: Still ship production code (Python, JS, SQL)
- **AI/ML**: RAG architectures, multi-modal pipelines, synthetic data generation

### What I'm Learning

Currently diving deep into:
- Neuroscience applications in UX (beyond "dopamine hits")
- Bayesian approaches to audience prediction
- Generative agents for behavioral simulation
- The cognitive science behind creative decision-making

### Outside Work

- **Fitness**: Muay Thai, BJJ, and arguing with my pull-up bar
- **Making**: Building unnecessary robots that my wife tolerates
- **Gaming**: Optimizing Baldur's Gate 3 builds with the same rigor I apply to product metrics
- **Languages**: Fluent in English and Portuguese, functional in Italian and Spanish, learning German one phrase at a time
