## <span id="tldr">TL;DR</span>
- System 1 (fast thinking) dominates 95% of product decisions
- A/B test interpretation suffers from availability heuristic
- North AI's attention metrics bypass cognitive biases
- Practical framework for dual-process product decisions

## <span id="the-3pm-product-review-trap">The 3pm Product Review Trap</span>

Last Tuesday, 3pm. Product review. 12 stakeholders on Zoom. 

The data scientist shares the A/B test results: *"Variant B shows 3.2% lift, p=0.073."*

What happens next is pure System 1 chaos...

<CalloutBox type="warning">
**The Availability Heuristic Strikes Again**: When we see "3.2% lift," our System 1 immediately searches for similar patterns. "Remember when we changed the CTA color and got 2.8%? This feels right."
</CalloutBox>

The problem isn't the dataâ€”it's how our brains process it. Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory explains why even data-driven teams make irrational decisions.

## <span id="the-north-ai-approach">The North AI Approach: Measuring Attention Before Opinion</span>

At North AI, we've built synthetic audiences that don't have System 1. 
They can't be primed. They don't get tired at 3pm.

Here's how we map cognitive load to actual metrics:

## <span id="framework-dual-process">Framework: Dual-Process Product Decisions</span>

| Decision Type | System 1 Trigger | System 2 Override | North AI Metric |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Feature Priority | "Competitor has it" | Impact modeling | Attention allocation |
| Creative Choice | "Feels engaging" | Statistical significance | Gaze synchronization |
| Audience Segment | "Our users love this" | Behavioral clustering | Neural activation patterns |

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Pro Tip**: Create "slow thinking" checkpoints in your process. When you feel confident about a decision, that's exactly when you need System 2 to take over.
</CalloutBox>

## <span id="next-steps">Next Steps</span>
1. Audit your last 5 product decisions for System 1 dominance
2. Install attention metrics alongside conversion metrics
3. Create "slow thinking" checkpoints in your process
