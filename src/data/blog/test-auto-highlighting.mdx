# Testing Auto-Concept Highlighting

This post tests the automatic highlighting of concept terms in blog post text.

## What Should Be Highlighted

The following terms should be automatically highlighted when they appear in the text:

### Engineering Concepts
- **Geometric Division**: This is a fundamental concept in finite element analysis where we break down complex structures into smaller elements.
- **Mesh generation**: Another term for geometric division, this process creates computational grids.
- **Discretization**: The mathematical process of converting continuous problems into discrete ones.

### Cognitive Science Concepts  
- **Cognitive Load Distribution**: This describes how mental effort is allocated across different cognitive systems.
- **Mental effort distribution**: An alternative term for the same concept.
- **Attention allocation**: How we distribute our cognitive resources.

## Testing Different Contexts

### In Paragraphs
When discussing engineering principles, geometric division becomes essential for understanding how complex structures are analyzed. Similarly, cognitive load distribution helps us understand how users process information in digital interfaces.

### In Lists
- Geometric division is used in structural analysis
- Cognitive load distribution affects user experience design
- Both concepts involve breaking down complex systems

### In Code Context (Should NOT be highlighted)
```javascript
// geometric division should not be highlighted here
function geometricDivision(value) {
  return value / 2;
}

// cognitive load distribution should not be highlighted here
const cognitiveLoadDistribution = calculateLoad();
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Automatic Detection**: Terms should be automatically detected and highlighted
2. **Click Interaction**: Clicking highlighted terms should show a modal with concept preview
3. **New Tab Option**: The modal should have an icon to open the concept page in a new tab
4. **Code Exclusion**: Terms in code blocks should NOT be highlighted
5. **Case Insensitive**: Both "Geometric Division" and "geometric division" should work

Let's see if this auto-highlighting feature works correctly!
