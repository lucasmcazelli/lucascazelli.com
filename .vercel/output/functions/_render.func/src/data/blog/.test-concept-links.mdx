# Testing Concept Links

This is a test post to verify that the concept linking functionality works properly.

## Testing Different Link Types

### Using ConceptLink Component
Here's a link to <ConceptLink concept="geometric-division">geometric division</ConceptLink> concept.

### Using Term Component
Here's a link to <Term id="cognitive-load-distribution">cognitive load distribution</Term> concept.

### Testing with Custom Text
Here's a link to <ConceptLink concept="geometric-division">spatial segmentation</ConceptLink> using custom display text.

## What Should Work

1. **Clickable Links**: All concept links should be clickable and navigate to the concept pages
2. **Hover Effects**: Links should show hover effects indicating they're interactive
3. **Modal Preview**: Clicking links should show a modal with concept preview (if modal is working)
4. **Visual Styling**: Links should be visually distinct from regular text

## Expected Behavior

- Clicking any concept link should either:
  - Open the concept page directly, OR
  - Show a modal preview of the concept with an option to view the full page

Let's see if this works!
